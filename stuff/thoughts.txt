# Thinking about the model base interface

## What exactly should queries return:

### model queries

Option 1: "success" only
  advantage: few data to transmit
  disadvantae: usually client will subsequently use the model and hence needs to manually query it anyway
  
Option 2: the header of the created model
  advantage: usability!
  disadvantage: more data to submit

Option 3: client may choose between option 1 and option2
  BEST!

### prediction queries

prediction queries should return a data frame, i.e. actually something very similar to a result table.

Question: Which random variables should be included in that data frame / result table? 
Answer: Easy. Exactly those as specified by the user!

Question: prediction queries are likely to cause new models to be derived. How to name / cache / return them?
Answer (naming): the name should be given by the user by means of a "AS"-clause
Answer (cache) : pff...
Answer (return): Either not at all (I think that makes most sense), or in a separate part of the result
	
Question: shouldn't I allow "AS" in prediction queries too? This way the 'base model' of a prediction query could be given a name and stored in the model base
Answer: yep, I think that makes a lot of sense!
